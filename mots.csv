modifie ces deux fichiers pour intégrer les bgp policies qu on a  configuré au-dessus sur les routeurs tout en respectant les consignes : 
The intent file MUST describe which Interior Gateway Protocol is used in an AS. The script will auto-
matically enable the specified IGP on the routers of the AS.
The intent file MUST describe to which BGP AS a given router belongs. The intent file MUST
capture the necessary information for the iBGP sessions and eBGP to be established.
3.4 Policies je veux que tu me donnes le code complet pour chaque fichier
3.4.1 BGP Policies
Specific routing policies are typically applied on BGP sessions based on the business relationship with the
neighboring AS. The intent file SHOULD capture such policies so that network automation can tweak
the policies applied on the eBGP sessions accordingly.
• Learn how to tag routes received from eBGP neighbours with communities.
• Learn how to configure iBGP sesssions to transmit communities along with BGP paths.
• Learn how to filter routes using route-maps based on BGP communities.
• Tag paths received from an eBGP neighbor with a community in your gns setup.
• Filter the paths advertised to another eBGP neighbor so as to only advertise the paths which have
the community.
Once this is done, you can automate your external policies in your network configuration tool.
• Adapt your intent file so as to be able to describe whether a neigbhouring AS is a customer, a
provider, or a settlement-free peer.
• Automate the setting of the local-pref attribute of BGP paths so as to prefer customers over
settlement-free peers over providers.
• Automate the configuration of your policies using communities so as to only propagate customer
paths to providers and settlement-free peers.
• Enjoy the fact that your peers and providers no longer get free rides on your network(s) :)

3.4.2 OSPF Metric Optimization
OSPF can be engineered for better traffic distribution by setting link costs to other values than the
default capacity-based value. The intent file SHOULD allow for the definition of such metrics.
• Learn how to set the metric of a link in OSPFv3 using the cost command.
• Validate the effect of the cost command has on your internal routing.
• Allow for the configuration of such costs in your intent file
